`useCopilotChatSuggestions` integrates auto-generated chat suggestions into your application in the context of your
app's state. It dynamically manages suggestions based on provided configurations and
dependencies.
 
<RequestExample>
  ```jsx useCopilotChatSuggestions Example
  import { useCopilotChatSuggestions }
    from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 
  useCopilotChatSuggestions({
    instructions: "Your instructions for suggestions.",
  })
  ```
</RequestExample>
 
## Basic Setup
 
To incorporate this hook into your React components, start by importing it:
 
```tsx
import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
```
 
Then, use it in your component to initiate suggestion functionality:
 
```tsx
useCopilotChatSuggestions({
  instructions: "Your instructions for suggestions.",
});
```
 
## Dependency Management
 
```tsx
import { useCopilotChatSuggestions } from "@copilotkit/react-ui";
 
useCopilotChatSuggestions(
  {
    instructions: "Suggest the most relevant next actions.",
  },
  [appState],
);
```
 
In the example above, the suggestions are generated based on the given instructions.
The hook monitors `appState`, and updates suggestions accordingly whenever it changes.
 
## Behavior and Lifecycle
 
The hook registers the configuration with the chat context upon component mount and
removes it on unmount, ensuring a clean and efficient lifecycle management.
